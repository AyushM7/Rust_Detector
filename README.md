# Rust Detector

Rust Detector: A project focused on improving railway track safety standards by detecting rust on tracks. The system utilizes OpenCV for image processing, TensorFlow for advanced pattern recognition, and NumPy for efficient numerical calculations, providing a robust solution for identifying rust in real time.
## Features

- Real-time rust detection using a webcam.
- Highlights detected rust areas with red rectangles.
- Easy to configure HSV color range for accurate rust detection.

## Libraries and Concepts Used

- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- HSV Color Space
- Contour Detection


## Future Enhancements

- Integrate more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Enhance detection capabilities to work in varying environmental conditions like low light or rain.
